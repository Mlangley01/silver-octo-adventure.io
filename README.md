Second attempt to launch website always read to the end of docs
Coding pages from a web-building project undertaken as part of my effort to move into the wider field of technology the main code itself will produce a functional website and leaves room for plenty of expansion as i continue my learning journey in the world of technology. To start i have focused on the basics of making the site responsive to size of the viewing screen which enables it to be viewed on multiple devices scaled to fit the screens rather than clump objects in a tangled mess.
